      <p><b>Research</b></p>
      <p>After Covid started and University ended I was stuck for a 
	  project to do. I played around with a few ideas and eventually 
	  came up with this idea. A scarper and server to host the data on 
	  the network.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Scraper</h2>
      <h5>July 7, 2020</h5>
     
      <p><b>Scraper Software</b></p>
      <p>After using Python previously for a scraper I decided to use 
	  it again. I started by finding a pollen counting site, using 
	  weather.ie which had a nice layout (if terribly awkward class names). 
	  I then used my knowledge of Python to gather this data and save 
	  it to a text file.<br>This scraper involves a loop so it will run and update the data every night.</p>
    </div>
	<div class="card">
      <h2>Server Software</h2>
      <h5>Server research & implemtation, July 8, 2020</h5>
      <p><b>Server Software</b></p>
      <p>Starting off without much of an understanding I quickly learned. I set my eyes on XAMPP, I got 
	  everything downaloded, then hit a roadblock. No matter what I did the installation would fail.<br>
	  With a hours of work I still made it nowhere. But keep in mind I am running this on an Optiplex 745,
	  with 3gb of ram, a Core 2 Duo and three drives, one of which is almost 10 years old. Also the computer 
	  is also a decade years old.<br><br>Either way with some time I gave up and went in search of something else.
	  Setting eyes on Wamp. After some time of setting up the C++ distributions I had success!<br><br> Then 
	  blue screen of death...</p>
    </div>
	<div class="card">
      <h2>Website</h2>
      <h5>July 8, 2020</h5>
	  <img style="height:200px;" src="pollen count.JPG" alt="My site pollen dosplay">
      <p><b>HTML Work</b></p>
      <p>Now that I have the server working and I didnt want to deal with the blue screem. I started working on the 
	  visual aspet of the data. I created a small index to pull the data and display in an appealing way. Emulating 
	  the weather website to a degree.</p>
    </div>
	<div class="card">
      <h2>Computer</h2>
      <h5>July 9, 2020</h5>
	  <img style="height:200px;text-align:center;" src="bsod.JPG" alt="Blue screen of death">
      <p><b>Blue Screen</b></p>
      <p>Now I had to deal with the blue screen. The machine I'm working with only has 3gb of ram alongside the 
	  afformetioned issues. This is an issue for many reasons. I was thinking of ways to fix this when I landed on a better idea.
	  When the computer blue screens it does some diagnostic work then restarts. Instead of fixing the issue, I can just work around it.
	  <br><br>I created a script to start all necessary programs on pc start. I also disabled the need for a username and password. So it will
	  log straight in and lastly I disabled the admin window so it does not ask for priviledges on server start.<br>This adds a satisfactory level
	  of reliability which I am very proud of.</p>

      <h2>Finished</h2>
      <h5>July 9, 2020</h5>
	  <img style="height:200px;text-align:center;" src="final.jpg" alt="Finished product">
      
      <p>Although some work can still be done, for instance tidying the code, for now I am happy with my creation. The Git is 
	  linked if you want to have a look. Now its just a matter of seeing how reliable the pc is and is anything breaks with time.</p>

      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <!--<div class="fakeimg" style="height:100px;">Image</div>-->
      <p>I always need to have a project to keep me entertained. To this end I came up with this idea during the famous Summer of 2020 to keep myself programmatically occupied.</p>
